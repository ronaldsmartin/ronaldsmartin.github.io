My name is Ronald, and I'm a native San Franciscan. <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

I'm a logician and computer scientist by education ([St. Ignatius '10](http://www.siprep.org/); [UPenn '14](http://www.upenn.edu/)), and I love learning new things! I'd like to use this website to post interesting things I'd learn. Currently, the posts are all about programming, but look out for some upcoming posts on other topics.

I really enjoy building stuff, particularly mobile apps. I also occasionally build for the web.

## Activities

My non-technical interests include (but are certainly not limited to):

### Music
Discovering and enjoying new music is one of my passions. My recent playlist has contained mostly electronic funk and R&B, but I really believe in music as art and strive to appreciate all genres.

I'd really like to make my own music and will write about how that goes eventually. I just bought a tambourine and am pretty pumped about it, but usually strum on my ukulele and sing a lot.

### Casual Math
Have you heard of the [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)? Well, it turns out that once you get 23 people in a room, you have about a 50% chance of two people inside sharing the same birthday!

I don't engage with higher level math as much as I used to, but I still take a special joy in learning about results and problems like this illustrate our world just a bit better.

### Delicious Foods!
I love trying new foods. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a foodie; I am an equal opportunity nom-er. If you ask me to try a new restaurant with you, I will probably say yes.

### Philosophy
Sometimes you need nourishment for your mind too, right? Here's one of my favorites to discuss, courtesy of my friend Joe:

> If you had to choose between being able to eat whatever you want with no negative consequences or never having to eat again, which would you pick?

I enjoy eating as much as the next guy, but I'd actually go with the second one for reasons I'd be happy to discuss with you. I'd also love to hear what you think!

### Volleyball
I've played volleyball since high school and try to keep up as time permits by going to open gyms and working as a volunteer coach for a local youth team.

### Basketball
I don't really play any more, but I grew up in the Bay and support the Golden State Warriors. Go Dubs!

### Reading
I read a lot and love to do it. I am a bit of a news junkie, but tend toward adventure stories in my spare time.

### Gaming
I like board games and video games and especially enjoy playing co-op games with other people.
When I play on my own, I usually go for action RPGs (_Dragon Age_, _Legend of Zelda_) or puzzle games (_Ace Attorney_, _Pushmo_).

## Let's Connect

If you'd like to connect, you can find me on social media via the links on the sidebar. I have found that maintaining a constant presence on every platform can get in the way of living the life that I want to lead, so it might take me a bit of time to get back to you. If you start off by answering the _would you rather_ question about eating vs. not eating, I will definitely respond more quickly.
