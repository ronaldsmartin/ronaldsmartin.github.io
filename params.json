I'm a logician by education, and having also majored in Computer Science I have a healthy appreciation for the power and beauty of design and algorithms.\r\n\r\nI like adventures. Other interests include volleyball, satires, food, and discussions about symbols.\r\n\r\n## Find Me\r\nI live in San Francisco, but unless you're physically seeking me you can reach me through social media:\r\n* [GitHub](@ronaldsmartin) (How else did you get here, anyway?)\r\n* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/118361948206637506928/posts/p/pub)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ronsm21)\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ronald-martin/66/bb7/299)\r\n\r\n## Current Projects\r\n### APO-DZ\r\nApplications to facilitate community service and communication for my undergraduate community service group, [Alpha Phi Omega](http://upennapo.org). The app provides native interfaces on iOS and Android to communicate with fellow brothers and to create/search/sign up for/report service projects & other chapter events.\r\n\r\nAs an app to help my friends and the local Philadelphia community, APO-DZ has served as my primary point of entry for exploratory forays into different platforms:\r\n* Android app\r\n  - About: http://ronaldsmartin.github.io/APO-DZ-Android/\r\n  - Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Android\r\n  - On the Play Store: [![Get it on Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.upennapo.app)\r\n* iPhone app\r\n  - Source code currently hiding in a private repo until I can remove all private data\r\n  - On the App Store: [![Get it on the App Store](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/en_us//images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.svg)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apo-dz/id862246150?mt=8&uo=4)\r\n* a web version built using Google Polymer web components is in-progress\r\n* a Windows Phone version may be created depending on how the webapp goes\r\n* the Google Apps Script that makes this possible [is a Gist here on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/ronaldsmartin/47f5239ab1834c47088e).\r\n\r\n### Penn Philippine Association App\r\nFollowing a lot of interest in the APO app's directory functionality from non-APO classmates, by the end of this summer I intend to generalize the patterns implicit in APO-DZ and build a generic directory module that college student organizations can adapt. The first fork shall be for my favorite collegiate Filipinos, the [Penn Philippine Association](www.dolphin.upenn.edu/ppa).\r\n\r\n### Automated Theorem Deducers\r\nAs a big fan of recursion and functional programming, one of my hobbies has been working on modeling proof systems in Haskell. The source code will be open-sourced as things come to fruition.\r\n\r\n## Older Projects\r\n### Comegys Reporter\r\nA proof-of-concept native Android app for student behavior reporting. Built for the [Comegys Elementary School](http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/c/comegys) in Philadelphia, the app allows teachers to create, save, and manage student behavior reports in a cloud database hosted by Parse.\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/Comegys-Behavior-Android\r\n\r\n### Chores-at-4030\r\nA Ruby on Rails webapp built as a class project for CIS 196 designed to let houses keep track of their chores.\r\n* Check it out here: http://chores-at-4030.herokuapp.com/\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/chores-at-4030\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
