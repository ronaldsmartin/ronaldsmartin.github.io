I'm a logician by education, and having also majored in Computer Science I have a healthy appreciation for the power and beauty of design and algorithms.\r\n\r\nI like adventures. Other interests include volleyball, satires, food, and discussions about symbols.\r\n\r\n## Current Projects\r\n### APO-DZ\r\nApplications to facilitate community service and communication for my undergraduate community service group, [Alpha Phi Omega](http://upennapo.org). The app provides native interfaces on iOS and Android to communicate with fellow brothers and to create/search/sign up for/report service projects & other chapter events.\r\n\r\nAs an app to help my friends and the local Philadelphia community, APO-DZ has served as my primary point of entry for exploratory forays into different platforms:\r\n* the [Android version](http://ronaldsmartin.github.io/APO-DZ-Android/) began and remains [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Android)\r\n* the iOS version is currently hiding in a private repo until I can remove all private data\r\n* a web version built using Google Polymer web components is in-progress\r\n* a Windows Phone version may be created depending on how the webapp goes\r\n* JavaScript that makes this possible [is a Gist](https://gist.github.com/ronaldsmartin/47f5239ab1834c47088e) here on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Penn Philippine Association App\r\nFollowing a lot of interest in the APO app's directory functionality from classmates, by the end of this summer I intend to generalize the patterns implicit in APO-DZ and build a generic directory module that college student organizations can adapt. The first fork shall be for my favorite collegiate Filipinos, the [Penn Philippine Association](www.dolphin.upenn.edu/ppa).\r\n\r\n### Automated Theorem Deducers\r\nAs a big fan of recursion and functional programming, one of my hobbies has been working on modeling proof systems in Haskell. The source code will be open-sourced as things come to fruition.\r\n\r\n## Find Me\r\nI live in San Francisco, but unless you're physically seeking me you can reach me through social media:\r\n* [GitHub](@ronaldsmartin) (How else did you get here, anyway?)\r\n* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/118361948206637506928/posts/p/pub)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ronsm21)\r\n* LinkedIn","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
