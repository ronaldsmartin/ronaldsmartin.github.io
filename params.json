{"name":"Ronald Martin","tagline":"Sharing (code) is caring","body":"# Hi, I'm Ronald.\r\nWelcome to my world.\r\n\r\n## About\r\nI'm a native San Franciscan and alum of [St. Ignatius College Prep.](http://www.siprep.org/) and [UPenn](http://www.upenn.edu). I'm also logician and computer scientist by education, so I like design, algorithms/proofs, and modeling things. Other interests include volleyball, adventure stories, casual math, philosophy, and good eats.\r\n\r\n![Me](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/1779133_10154088359450157_4610327100335440114_n.jpg?oh=2987797123c8dd006c86ebe70863f318&oe=547F9DB8)\r\n\r\nI'm the one in front wearing the wrong color.

The app provides native interfaces on iOS and Android to communicate with fellow brothers and to create/search/sign up for/report service projects & other chapter events.\r\n\r\nAs an app to help my friends and the local Philadelphia community, APO-DZ has served as my primary point of entry for exploratory forays into unfamiliar technologies:\r\n\r\n####  Android app\r\n* About: http://ronaldsmartin.github.io/APO-DZ-Android/\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Android\r\n\r\n[![Get it on Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.upennapo.app)\r\n\r\n####  iPhone app\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-iOS\r\n\r\n[![Get it on the App Store](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/en_us//images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.svg)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apo-dz/id862246150?mt=8&uo=4)\r\n\r\n####  Google Apps Script\r\nThe API that makes this possible [is a Gist here on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/ronaldsmartin/47f5239ab1834c47088e).\r\n\r\n####  Other\r\n* a web version built using Google Polymer web components is unfortunately not public because of private brother data\r\n* a Windows Phone version is planned but not currently in progress\r\n\r\n### Mater Dolorosa App\r\nNative Android app for my parish. Currently, it uses the current date and time to provide up-to-date information about service times and office hours, as well as easing access to appropriate personnel. Future plans involve creating a dashboard for current and future events, but that entails setting up a backend somewhere and more careful planning.\r\n\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/mater-dolorosa-android\r\n\r\n\r\n### Penn Philippine Association App\r\nFollowing a lot of interest in the APO app's directory functionality from non-APO classmates, by the end of this summer I hope to generalize the patterns implicit in APO-DZ and build a generic directory module that college student organizations can adapt. The first fork shall be for my favorite collegiate Filipinos, the [Penn Philippine Association](www.dolphin.upenn.edu/ppa).\r\n\r\n## Inactive (Older/Complete) Projects\r\n### Name Formatter for APO Update Forms\r\nThe backend of the APO spreadsheet is built upon a network of Google Sheets, Forms, and update scripts created by my awesome robotics-master roommate, Dean (@turniphead). These forms require a specific format for brother names that is inconvenient to produce without a programmer's text editor (three cheers for regexps!). This simple webapp solves that problem.\r\n* Check it out: http://ronaldsmartin.github.io/APO-DZ-Form-Name-Formatter/\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Form-Name-Formatter\r\n\r\n\r\n### Comegys Reporter\r\nA proof-of-concept native Android app for student behavior reporting. Built for the [Comegys Elementary School](http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/c/comegys) in Philadelphia during the course of Penn's [CIS 350](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cdmurphy/cis350/), the app allows teachers to create, save, and manage student behavior reports in a cloud database hosted by Parse.\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/Comegys-Behavior-Android\r\n\r\n### Automated Theorem Deducers\r\nAs a big fan of recursion and functional programming, one of my interests has been working on modeling proof systems in Haskell. The original version for Gentzen's sequent calculus was built during Penn's [FA'13 Advanced Programming course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis552/13fa/index.html) with my partner, Anne Foster. Code will be open-sourced as time permits.\r\n\r\n### Chores-at-4030\r\nA Ruby on Rails webapp built as a class project for CIS 196 designed to let houses keep track of their chores.\r\n* Check it out here: http://chores-at-4030.herokuapp.com/\r\n* Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/chores-at-4030\r\n\r\n## Thanks for visiting!\r\nTo commemorate your journey, a few of my friends and I took this ridiculous picture to salute you.\r\n\r\n![Sergeant Salute](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t1.0-9/p480x480/10011186_636425083089346_1937704987_n.jpg)\r\n\r\nFarewell!
