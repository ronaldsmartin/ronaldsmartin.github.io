This is my website. It's built with [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), a Go-based static site generator, and hosted here with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Active development takes place on the `[hugo-site](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/ronaldsmartin.github.io/tree/hugo-site)` branch. The (`master`) branch is generated from the Hugo source and is what is actually served on the web.

You can [view the result here](http://ronaldsmartin.github.io)!
