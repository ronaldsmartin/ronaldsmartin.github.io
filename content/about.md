My name is Ronald, and I'm a native San Franciscan. <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>


I'm a logician and computer scientist by education ([St. Ignatius '10](http://www.siprep.org/); [UPenn '14](http://www.upenn.edu/)), and I love learning new things!

I really enjoy building stuff, particularly mobile apps. I also occasionally build websites.

My non-technical interests include (but are certainly not limited to):

* playing volleyball
* adventure stories
* casual math
* philosophy
* discovering new music
* co-op games
* delicious foods!
